This repository restructures the original LIGO code for improved reproducibility. The new package named ligotools is created and the readligo.py file is imported from that package as named rl. Also there is an environment.yml file which describes the version of python and necessary packages with environment name ligo. Also here's the binder where you can check the code and data and you can run it!
